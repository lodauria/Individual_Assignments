# Performance evaluation

## Performance metrics:

*Consider the benefits of deploying multiple sensors with overlapping observation areas in terms of data quality, fault tolerance, and energy efficiency.*

In the rest of this document the performance of the overall wireless sensor network is evaluated by considering the power consumption and the wireless network reliability.

## Power consumption

The power consumption of the nodes has been monitored with the FIT IoT-Lab tools with the following results for each type of node.

### Border router

*Measure the energy consumption and duty cycling of the nodes keeping in mind the overall performance of the wireless sensor network.*

### Sensor node

*Measure the energy consumption and duty cycling of the nodes keeping in mind the overall performance of the wireless sensor network.*

## Network performance

- *Identify the technical limitations of a multi-hop wireless network in terms of throughput, end-to-end delay and security.*
- *Measure the performance of the wireless sensor network. Measure the end-to-end latency and throughput. Measure the overall quality of the wireless communication channel.*
- *Evaluate the performance of the system as the number of wireless elements increases. How does the physical location of the nodes affect the performance of the wireless network? Examine wireless network topologies of different diameter.*
