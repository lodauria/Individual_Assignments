Make sure to have installed [RIOTS-OS](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT), [Mosquitto RSMB](https://github.com/eclipse/mosquitto.rsmb), [Mosquitto broker](https://github.com/eclipse/mosquitto) and to have active [AWS](https://www.awseducate.com/signin/SiteLogin?ec=302&startURL=%2Fstudent%2Fs%2F), [FIT IOT-Lab](https://www.iot-lab.info/testbed/login?next=%2Fdashboard) and [The Things Network](https://account.thethingsnetwork.org/) accounts.

### Setup a TTN device



### Submit an IoT LAB experiment



### Setup a LoRaWAN sensor node:

#### Makefile adjustments



#### Compile and upload software



### Integration with the previous assignments

The same system configuration seen for the [second assignment](second_assiginment.md) can be used if we want to integrate the LoRa devices with the components developed in in the previous assignments.


### AWS setup

Refer to the [dedicated folder](aws/) to set up AWS. Note that for this assignment some additional components has to be added with respect to the previous assignments.
